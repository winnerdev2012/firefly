// Parked represents a ledger-pinning event that has been
// detected from the blockchain, but cannot be processed immediately.
//
// A batch contains many messages, and each of those messages can be on a different
// topic (or topics)
// All messages on the same topic must be processed in the order that
// the batch pinning events arrive from the blockchain.
//
// For broadcasts the hash of all pinning events in the sequence
// is the same.
// For private group messages, the hash is obviscated in a way that it
// is deterministic what the next hash will be for each sender in that group.
//
// As we need to correlate the on-chain events, with off-chain data that might
// arrive at a different time (or never), we "park" all pinned sequences first,
// then only complete them (and generate the associated events) once all the data
// has been assembled for all messages on that sequence, within that batch.
