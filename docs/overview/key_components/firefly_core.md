## FireFly Core

FireFly Core acts as the brain for the SuperNode. There are two main components which is the Orchestration Engine, Event Bus, Data, and State management.

Support for multiple protocols across public and private chains with a powerful orchestration engine backed by a scalable event bus. Manage private data, on-chain data, and shared storage. Track state across networks, chains, and internal back office systems.
