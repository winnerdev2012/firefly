## Types of blockchain project that benefit

There are two main reasons your project might be exploring Supernodes, and considering the open source
approach of Hyperledger FireFly.

### Solution builders

Teams building new decentralized Web3 solutions need a full technology stack for
the application, to manage both private and blockchain data. Particularly in the enterprise space
due to data security, regulatory and privacy concerns.

For theses solutions to be successful, they need decentralized deployment to multiple parties.
Each party needs to customize the deployment to their SecDevOps environment, as well as
onboard it to their key management solution etc.

So the complexity of requiring a bespoke technology stack for a solution can be a barrier to its adoption.

Whereas, building on top of a standardized and open technology stack can ease adoption, as well
as radically reducing the amount of engineering needed by the solution developer.

### Organizations needing a gateway to Web3

Organizations are increasingly participating in multiple blockchain projects, and integrating with
digital assets in multiple blockchain ecosystems.

This means core IT security policy needs to scale to the challenge of adding these connections,
and managing the wallets / signing identities, data flow, and SecDevOps requirements across multiple
projects.

A gateway tier at the edge between the core systems of the enterprise, and the Web3 transactions,
helps reduce the overhead, and reduce risk.
