Starting with FireFly v1.1, it's easy to connect to public Ethereum chains. This guide will walk you through the steps to create a local FireFly development environment and connect it to the NEAR testnet.
​
## Previous steps: Install the FireFly CLI
If you haven't set up the FireFly CLI already, please go back to the Getting Started guide and read the section on how to [Install the FireFly CLI](../../gettingstarted/firefly_cli.md).
​
[← ① Install the FireFly CLI](../../gettingstarted/firefly_cli.md){: .btn .btn-purple .mb-5}
​
## Create an `evmconnect.yml` config file
In order to connect to the NEAR testnet, you will need to set a few configuration options for the evmconnect blockchain connector. Create a text file called `evmconnect.yml` with the following contents:
​
```yml
confirmations:
    required: 4
policyengine.simple:
    fixedGasPrice: null
    gasOracle:
        mode: connector
```
​
For this tutorial, we will assume this file is saved at `~/Desktop/evmconnect.yml`. If your path is different, you will need to adjust the path in the next command below.
​
## Creating a new stack
To create a local FireFly development stack and connect it to the NEAR testnet, we will use command line flags to customize the following settings:
​
 - Create a new stack named `near` with `1` member
 - Disable `multiparty` mode. We are going to be using this FireFly node as a Web3 gateway, and we don't need to communicate with a consortium here
 - Connect to an ethereum network
 - Use the `evmconnect` blockchain connector
 - Use an remote RPC node. This will create a signer locally, so that our signing key never leaves the development machine.
 - Set the remote RPC node URL to `https://rpc.testnet.near.org` (RPC nodes for other NEAR networks may be found here https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/setup)
 - Set the chain ID to any number (NEAR works with any chain ID)
 - Merge the custom config created above with the generated `evmconnect` config file
​
To do this, run the following command:
```
ff init near 1 \
    --multiparty=false \
    -b ethereum \
    -c evmconnect \
    -n remote-rpc \
    --remote-node-url https://rpc.testnet.near.org \
    --chain-id 1 \
    --connector-config ~/Desktop/evmconnect.yml
```
​
## Start the stack
Now you should be able to start your stack by running:
​
```
ff start near
```
​
After some time it should print out the following:
​
```
Web UI for member '0': http://127.0.0.1:5000/ui
Sandbox UI for member '0': http://127.0.0.1:5109
​
​
To see logs for your stack run:
​
ff logs near
```
​
## Get some NEAR
At this point you should have a working FireFly stack, talking to a public chain. However, you won't be able to run any transactions just yet, because you don't have any way to pay for gas. A testnet faucet can give us some NEAR, the native token for the NEAR protocol.
​
First, you will need to know what signing address your FireFly node is using. To check that, you can run:
​
```
ff accounts list near
[
  {
    "address": "0xa4ed2a9a99dfdf46f1812c38a1656ff2ad1f61da",
    "privateKey": "..."
  }
]
```
Note, for the NEAR protocol, the line labeled privateKey is the address you will use.

​Go to [https://near-faucet.io/](https://near-faucet.io/) and click **Connect with Near Testnet**. Next click **Create Accounte**, make an account ID, and choose a security method. Follow the steps for either the Seedphrase or Ledger Hardware Wallet until your NEAR account is created. Once complete you will be redirected to the original https://near-faucet.io/ page and are now able to request 20 NEAR tokens.

​
### Confirm the transaction on NEAR Testnet Explorer
Once the request for 20 NEAR tokens is completed, go to [https://explorer.testnet.near.org/](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/) and search via your account name. Once it is found click on the link under **Balance Profile** to access your NEAR wallet. From here, click the **Wallet** button in the top left and then **Send**. Choose a denomination of NEAR to send, enter your 64 character string denominated as privateKey from the FireFly CLI, and you will now have funded tokens in your account.

## Use the public testnet
Now that you have everything set up, you can follow one of the other FireFly guides such as [Using Tokens](../tokens/index.md) or [Custom Smart Contracts](../custom_contracts/ethereum.md). For detailed instructions on deploying a custom smart contract to NEAR, please see the [NEAR docs](https://docs.near.org/develop/contracts/introduction) for instructions using various tools.
