## Connect with us on Rocket Chat

You can chat with maintainers and other contributors on Rocket Chat in the `firefly-lab` channel:
https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/firefly-lab

If you don't have a Linux Foundation ID, you can sign up for a free account here:

## Finding your first issue

If you're looking for somewhere to get started in the FireFly project and want something small and relatively easy, take a look at [issues tagged with "Good first issue"](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ahyperledger%2Ffirefly+repo%3Ahyperledger%2Ffirefly-fabconnect+repo%3Ahyperledger%2Ffirefly-cli+repo%3Ahyperledger%2Ffirefly-samples+repo%3Ahyperledger%2Ffirefly-ethconnect+repo%3Ahyperledger%2Ffirefly-dataexchange-https+repo%3Ahyperledger%2Ffirefly-ui+repo%3Ahyperledger%2Ffirefly-cordaconnect+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=). You can definitely work on other things if you want to. These are only suggestions for easy places to get started.

## Setting up a local development environment

Here are some detailed instructions on [Setting up a local development environment](./dev_environment_setup.html)

## Making changes

To contribute to the repository, please [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) that you want to change. Then clone your fork locally on your machine and make your changes. As you commit your changes, push them to your fork. More information on making commits below.

## Commit with Developer Certificate of Origin

As with all Hyperledger repositories, FireFly requires proper sign-off on every commit that is merged into the `main` branch. The sign-off indicates that you certify the changes you are submitting in accordance with the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). To sign-off on your commit, you can use the `-s` flag when you commit changes.

```
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will add a string like this to the end of your commit message:

```
"Signed-off-by: Your Name <your-email@address>"
```

> **NOTE:** [Sign-off](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s) is _not_ the same thing as [signing your commits](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--Sltkeyidgt) with a private key. Both operations use a similar flag, which can be confusing. The one you want is the _lowercase_ `-s` ðŸ™‚

## Opening a Pull Request

When you're ready to submit your changes for review, [open a Pull Request back to the upstream repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). When you open your pull request, the maintainers will automatically be notified. Additionally, a series of automated checks will be performed on your code to make sure it passes certain repository specific requirements.

Maintainers may have suggestions on things to improve in your pull request. It is our goal to get code that is beneficial to the project merged as quickly as possible, so we don't like to leave pull requests hanging around for a long time. If the project maintainers are satisfied with the changes, they will approve and merge the pull request.

Thanks for your interest in collaborating on this project!
