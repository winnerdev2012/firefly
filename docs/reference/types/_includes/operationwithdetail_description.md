Operation with detail is an extension to operations that allow additional information to be encapsulated with an operation. An operation
can be supplemented by a connector and that information will be returned in a `detail` field.

Operation with detail is a superset of an [Operation](../_includes/operation_description.md). For information about the detail provided
by blockchain connectors see [Blockchain operation status](../../blockchain_operation_status.md).
