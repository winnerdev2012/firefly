The quickest way to get started with a local FireFly stack is through the [FireFly CLI](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli).  This will provide you with a set of Docker containers encapsulating the core FireFly componentry, all of which you can easily start, stop and remove from your machine with simple `ff` commands and the associatedflags.  

Once you have successfully installed and interacted with the FireFly CLI, you can extend your usage with the lightweight 
[Private Data Transfer](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-samples/tree/main/private-data-transfer-cli) sample application which implements a basic CLI workflow, along with same flow hosted on a React frontend.
