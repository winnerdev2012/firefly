## Work in progress

The passthrough APIs to invoke on-chain smart contracts direct, and subscribe to the events from
those transactions in your application, are currently under development.

You can access the APIs of the blockchain interface plugins directly, which perform the heavy lifting
to add an API/Event gateway in front of the low level blockchain RPC interfaces.

See [Key Concepts: Blockchain protocols](/firefly/keyconcepts/blockchain_protocols.html) for more information.
