## The FireFly Samples repo

A set of samples are provided to get you started. There is a CLI and a UI to exercise FireFly with your first
transactions, without needing to write any code.

You can then use the code itself as a starting point for building your own apps, or learning the API.

Check out the samples here: [FireFly Samples Repo](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-samples)
