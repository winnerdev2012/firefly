# FireFly

FireFly is a multiparty system for enterprise data flows, powered by blockchain. It solves all of the layers of complexity that sit between the low level blockchain and high level business processes and user interfaces. FireFly enables developers to build blockchain apps for enterprise radically faster by allowing them to focus on business logic instead of infrastructure.

FireFly focusses on:
- Providing a great developer API and experience, with a CLI and UI as first class project components
- Pluggability for implementations of multi-party system infrastructure (blockchains, off-chain data exchange, identity, compute etc.)
- Making proven multi-party system patterns easy for new projects to adopt
- Providing developer friendly access to custom transactions+events in the underlying blockchain platforms
- Giving visibility and control on the private data exchange that occurs between businesses in a multi-party system
- Simplifying the journey of building multi-party business processes, by empowering non-blockchain developers to build great APIs+UX
