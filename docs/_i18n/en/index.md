![Hyperledger FireFly](./images/hyperledger_firefly_social.png)

Hyperledger FireFly is an [open source Supernode](./overview/supernode_concept.html), a complete stack for enterprises to build and scale secure Web3 applications.

The easiest way to understand a FireFly Supernode is to think of it like a toolbox. Connect your existing apps and/or back office systems to the toolbox and within it there are two different sets of tools. One set of tools helps you connect to the Web3 world that already exists, and the other set allows you to build new decentralized applications quickly with security and scalability.
